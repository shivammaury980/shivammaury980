        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Greetings! I am Shivam Maurya, a first-year BCA student at Sage University, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, and I am
            proud to be powered by Sunstone Eduversity.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>I am passionate about coding, ethical hacking, and web development. This passion for technology and the
            digital world has led me to create this website, which serves as a platform for practicing coding and
            sharing my experiences in the field of technology. Throughout this journey, I have been guided by the
            knowledgeable and inspiring Arpita Tiwari Ma'am, who has been instrumental in shaping my understanding of
            these domains.</p>

        <h3>Educational Background</h3>

        <p>My educational journey has been a stepping stone to where I am today. I completed my 10th and 12th grades at
            Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh. The years 2020-21 and 2022-23 marked my academic
            milestones, and the knowledge and skills I acquired during these years have been instrumental in shaping my
            path in the world of technology.</p>

        <h3>Life in Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh, India</h3>

        <p>Fatehpur, a serene city in the heart of Uttar Pradesh, India, is where I call home. This city's rich cultural
            heritage and the warmth of its people have played a significant role in shaping my character and values. The
            city's vibrant atmosphere has always encouraged me to explore the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>

        <h3>Why This Website?</h3>

        <p>The creation of this website serves multiple purposes in my journey. Here are some of the key reasons:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Coding Practice</h4>
                <p>As a BCA student, coding is an essential part of my curriculum. This website acts as a virtual
                    playground where I can experiment with various coding projects, implement what I learn in my
                    courses, and showcase my coding skills to the world.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Sharing Knowledge</h4>
                <p>I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. Through blog posts, tutorials, and articles, I aim to
                    impart valuable insights and information related to coding, ethical hacking, and web development.
                    It's my way of giving back to the community and helping others on their learning journeys.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Guided by Arpita Tiwari Ma'am</h4>
                <p>Arpita Tiwari Ma'am has been a mentor and guide who has consistently inspired me to explore the
                    depths of technology. With her guidance, I've learned to think critically, solve complex problems,
                    and stay updated with the latest trends in the tech industry.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>My journey in the world of technology is just beginning, and I'm excited to see where it leads. I'm committed
            to continuous learning and growth, and I invite you to join me on this exciting voyage. Feel free to explore
            my website, read my articles, and reach out if you have any questions, feedback, or if you simply want to
